Architecture:

EC2 instance acts as secure bastion/jump host for RDS PostgreSQL administration

Private connectivity between EC2 and RDS within VPC

Eliminates need for direct public database access

Security Benefits:

✓ Centralized access control through EC2 security groups

✓ SSH key-based authentication for EC2 access

✓ RDS security group restricts access to EC2 instance only

✓ SSL/TLS encrypted connections between EC2 and RDS

✓ Audit trail via CloudWatch logs and AWS CloudTrail

Operational Advantages:

Single point of administration for database operations

Pre-installed PostgreSQL client tools (psql, pg_dump)

Automated backup scripts and maintenance tasks

Cost-effective: Small instance type sufficient for admin tasks

Power BI Integration:

On-premises gateway installed on EC2 for Power BI Service connectivity

Secure data pipeline: Power BI → Gateway (EC2) → RDS

Real-time dashboard updates with scheduled refresh

Best Practices Implemented:

Principle of least privilege (minimal security group rules)

Network isolation (private subnets for RDS)

Encrypted data in transit and at rest

Regular security patching via AWS Systems Manager
